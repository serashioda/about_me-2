  <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="bio">I'm a Canadian currently residing in Tacoma, WA. Coming from Canada, hockey was very prevelent in my life at an early age. I played pee-wee hockey and soon realized that playing the actual sport wasn't for me. My dreams of being the shortest hockey player in the NHL were short lived. Hence why I started pursuing a passion in music. My dad attempted to teach me guitar but found that I would use my fork and knife as drum sticks at the dinner table. A few years later I was playing drums in a pop-punk band with a few friends. Anyways, long story short (and shortly after starting the band) my buddy and I started a web design company in the early 2000's. We'd build websites using iframes and tables. Best part was getting the drop shadow on those iframe scrollbars. Eventually I got sucked into the music industry and started working for a record label. Now I am in school for programming as it's always been a huge piece of my ife, yet I never pursued a career in it, but would love to have the opportunity to do so. Something about me misses those endless headaches while staring at your code wondering what the hell is missing and soon realizing it's missing semi-colon. </p>
